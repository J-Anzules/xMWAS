#Changes in v0.52

1) fixed legend labels for 4-way analysis
2) changed all.missing.thresh to a user-defined option (previously it was set to 0.1)
3) removed redundant calls to network that was generating network first at corthresh=0 and then at the user-defined threshold. Only one network at the defined threshold is generated in the new version.
4) added degree.count and degree.weight options for centrality analysis (see Manual)
5) community detection: the software now compares walktrap and multilevel community and selects the option that gives higher modularity measure
6) fixed max_var option for 3-way and 4-way analysis. No changes to 2-way analysis.
